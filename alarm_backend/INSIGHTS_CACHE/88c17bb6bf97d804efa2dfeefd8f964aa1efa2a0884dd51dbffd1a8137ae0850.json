Crucially, the data sample for this record is an empty JSON object (`{}`), meaning no specific operational parameters, unit identification, or incident details are available. This represents an isolated, undefined anomaly.\n\n### 🩺 Diagnostic Analysis\nThe complete lack of descriptive data within the reported 'unhealthy record' (`{}`) precludes any meaningful diagnostic assessment. This situation is highly indicative of:\n1.  **Data Capture Failure:** The monitoring system registered an event but failed to capture or transmit any associated parameters or context.\n2.  **System Error/Corruption:** A transient software or hardware glitch may have generated a generic alert without a specific root cause.\n3.  **Undefined Alert Type:** The system might have triggered an alert for an event type that lacks a predefined data structure for detailed reporting.\nWithout specific unit, equipment, parameter, or timestamp information, it is impossible to attribute this 'unhealthy record' to a process deviation, equipment malfunction, or sensor anomaly.\n\n### 💡 Prescriptive Recommendations\n1.  **Immediate Data Integrity Check",
